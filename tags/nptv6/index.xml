      <description>Intro IPv6 is the successor to IPv4, but many necessities of IPv6 are still in development, which include a wide range of infrastructures (hardware / software), specifications (IETF RFCs), good practices followed by ISPs, and awareness of developers.&#xA;In home scenarios, many ISPs do allocate IPv6 prefixes for end-users via DHCPv6 PD (probably over PPPoE).&#xA;Even if the prefix is dynamic (changing on each dial or a daily basis), this is still quite good for most home users as long as they are using EXACTLY one router with decent support for dual-stack.</description>
