      <description>Intro RSA is currently the most widely used public-key cryptosystem in the world. In public-key cryptography, there are two kinds of keys: private keys and public keys. Private keys are generated by some algorithm and need to be kept secret by the operator. Public keys are directly derived from private keys and can be published publicly anywhere. A public key together with the private key which it&amp;rsquo;s derived from is called a key pair.</description>
